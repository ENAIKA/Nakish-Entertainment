     <td><strong><em>Substance abuse</em> </strong>refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs.
        One quarter of all young people have reported smoking marijuana at least once.
        Long-term studies indicate marijuana can cause serious physical and mental problems.
        Of particular concern are the effects of marijuana on young people whose bodies and minds are still rapidly developing. 
        Marijuana, like alcohol, can affect a person's memory, driving ability and school performance. It is particularly dangerous for an impulsive teenager to be using marijuana.
        Figures indicate alcohol use is sometimes tolerated by parents, especially those of older teens.
        If that's the case, parents should think again! In small doses, like all depressants, alcohol has a calming effect but long-term heavy use affects the liver, muscles, bonus, digestive tract, heart and brain.
        For some, alcohol can provide an easy escape from dealing with boredom, fears, depression, symptoms of ADHD, and frustration.<br>
        <strong>Note:</strong>
        <i>There is NOTHING more important in preventing drug abuse than spending time with your children.</i><br>
        <p id="deco">Take time to do what they enjoy, to share some skills, to build family rituals and rapport.<br>
